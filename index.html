                <div>"Iam an Experienced paramedic with several years of experience in a clinic rehabilitating children with complex illnesses. Iwas very attentive and took great responsibility for my work. I Demonstrated a love for children and high
                    stress tolerance in
                    dealing with medical tasks. Due to quarantine, Idecided to change career direction and this led to an interest in working remotely.
                    By mastering courses at Rsschool with a focus on coding, Iwent from zero knowledge to being confident in coding. This process took a lot of effort in the form of determination and perseverance. After all, the courses at this
                    school last more than a
                    year and are based on self-study and discipline. The certificates of completion emphasize my dedication to learning and commitment to professional growth.
                    Iam now actively seeking opportunities to apply my new skills and experience in programming, combining what I have learned with my previous medical background to tackle new challenges. Ihave excellent communication skills with
                    different people and
                    can easily find common ground. I learned this in the medical field. Ihave high stress tolerance and know what responsibility is."</div>

                    </li>
                    <p>We have developed an online store project based on Rs-School courses. A very extensive project, which has several types of search, pagination, the ability to add items to cart, use promo codes, and fill out a registration form
                        before purchase. The
                        project is based on React and Typescript. My responsibilities included the development of some filters, cart page, form, as well as the distribution of work using trello and control of the project in the specified time.</p>

                    </li>
                    <p>The project is based on teamwork. We have been developing an analog graph-ql. My role was to create a user authorization page using firebase, as well as fully organize the work of all team members so that it was autonomous
                        and no one depended on each
                        other. I tried to arrange phone calls with the team, to find out the problems they faced in the process of work. I created a table of our work and deadlines using Jira. As a result, we successfully completed our tasks.</p>
