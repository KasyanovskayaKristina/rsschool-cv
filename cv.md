## About me

> _To achieve great success, you need not only to act but also to dream...._

### My career began as a deputy of Tesla owner Ilon Musk. After that, I got bored and decided to fill in for Ilon as chief engineer at SpaceX. And after SpaceX, I realized that I wanted to be an astronaut, so I became one. But when I found out that the RS School was starting JS developer course, I gave up my career as a successful deputy owner, chief engineer, and astronaut to become a JS Developer, yahoooooooooooo!!!
